2d grappling hook
The notable components the Player GameObject has right now are a capsule collider and a rigidbody which allow it to interact with physical objects in the level. There’s also a simple movement script (PlayerMovement) attached that lets your slippery character slide along the ground and perform basic jumps.

Click the Play button in the editor to start the game and try out the controls to see how they feel. A or D will move you left or right, and space will perform jumps. Be careful not to slip and fall off the rocks or you’ll die
